InfantCore
==========

Code from the Infantcore Blob-tracking installation for Machine Project. Just a very simple blob-tracking app with background subtraction and the ability to zero in on six unique colors using a kinect and openFrameworks.

NOTE: This code was very rapidly developed in a matter of hours so it was based off of a template and thus maintains stupid names like test.cpp and test.h.

TODO:
  Fix that
